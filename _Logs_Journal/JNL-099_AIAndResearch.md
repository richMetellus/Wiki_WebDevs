- Build apps that work offline and have a native app feel.

#### **WebAssembly (WASM)**

- For performance-critical tasks in web applications.

#### **Headless CMS**

- Strapi, Contentful: Manage content separately from the front-end.

---

### **6. Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Testing Frameworks**:
  - Jest (JavaScript/React).
  - Cypress (end-to-end testing).
  - Mocha and Chai (Node.js).

---

### **Learning Path:**

1. **Beginner**:
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - Git and basic deployment using platforms like Netlify.
   - Simple projects like portfolio websites or landing pages.
2. **Intermediate**:
   - Learn React.js or Vue.js.
   - Master Node.js and Express.js for server-side development.
   - Learn RESTful APIs and MongoDB.
   - Build projects like blogs or e-commerce platforms.
3. **Advanced**:
   - Dive into GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.
   - Work on scalable and secure applications.
   - Explore DevOps practices and CI/CD.
